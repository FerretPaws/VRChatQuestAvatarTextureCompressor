# VRChatQuestAvatarTextureCompressor
A quick and easy to understand Python script that will turn all images inside of a Unity project's Asset folder into compressed images based on the resolution you set. The default is 512x512. This will save significant space on your avatars if you're trying to port them over for Quest 2.
